and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</h3> 

<h3>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its 
appearance</h3>
<h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML
(including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).</h3>
<h3> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</h3>
<h3>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including 
XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</h3>

incorporating third-party libraries.</h3>
<h3> All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</h3>
<h3>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core 
components of some servers and a variety of applications.</h3>
<h3> The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. </h3>
<h3>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard 
libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. </h3>

<h3> Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.</h3>
<h3> It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), objectoriented and functional programming.</h3>
<h3> It is often described as a "batteries included" 
language due to its comprehensive standard library.</h3>
<h3> Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the 
ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
Python 2.0 was released in 2000.<h3> 
Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.</h3>
<h3>Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.</h3>
<h3>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</h3>

anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that 
support Java without the need to recompile.</h3>
<h3> Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
<h3> The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them As of September 2023, Java 21 is the latest version, which is also a long-term 
support (LTS) version.</h3>
<h3> Java 8, 11, and 17 are previous LTS versions still officially supported.</h3>
